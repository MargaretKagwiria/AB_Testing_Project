## A/B Testing: Bayesian vs. Frequentist Methods
This project explores A/B testing techniques using Bayesian and Frequentist methods in Python, providing a comparison between the two approaches.

### Introduction
A/B testing is a powerful method to compare two versions of a variable to determine which performs better. This project focuses on implementing A/B testing using both Bayesian and Frequentist statistical methods. We are performing A/B testing on users by exposing one group to the old website and the other to the new website.

### Results
The output of both methods will be displayed, showcasing the comparison of results obtained through Bayesian and Frequentist approaches.

### Conclusion
Compare the results obtained from both methods and draw conclusions based on the analysis performed. Discuss the advantages and limitations of each method in the context of A/B testing.
